Description:
Computes the Gaussian blur of an image, with filename & standard deviation (blur strength) inputs.
Outputs an image of the same format, including the standard deviation used in the file name.

Included files:
 - gaussian_blur.py
 - README

Inputs:
sdev (float):
    The standard deviation of the n x n Gaussian matrix. n is the side length
    of the matrix, which is given as ceil(4*sdev). The matrix will cover at least
    four standard deviations of the Gaussian distributionl; n is guaranteed to be an odd
    value such that our distribution is centered around the center of the matrix.

filename (string):
    The name of the image to blur. Note: The extension must be included, and it must be a
    supported RGB image file format by Pillow:
    https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html#fully-supported-formats

Outputs:
savedfilename (image, format dependent on input used):
    The blurred image, given by 'blurred_sdev=<sdev>_filename'. This is given in the terminal.

Assumptions:
 - The standard deviation is a positive, nonzero float.
 - The image is RGB.
 - The image is supported by Pillow.

Instructions:
 - Make sure that NumPy & Pillow libraries are installed:
    - 'pip install Pillow'
    - 'pip install numpy'
    
 - To run the program (using the command line):
    - $ python3 gaussian_blur.py (Bash)
    - $ python gaussian_blur.py (PowerShell)

 - Follow the instructions as printed in the command line.
   Note that the time to compute the blur will depend on the size of the image, as well as the 
   standard deviation. Larger images and/or standard deviations will increase the time taken.
